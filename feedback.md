#Practical 5
I add the code below in variables.py:
```Python
X = True
Y = True
W = X and Y
print(W)
X = False
Y = False
W = X and Y
print(W)
X = True
Y = False
W = X and Y
print(W)
```
to find the law of Boolean value

In mystery_code.py, I change the notes to 'cycle for 10 times to create 10 random integers in range from 1 to 100 and out put the last random integer'

In both two figure I lack the labels.
In health.py I add the code below:
```Python
plt.xlabel("paternal age")
plt.ylabel("risk")
plt.title("relation between paternal age and disease risk")
```
In grade.py I add the code below:
```Python
plt.xlabel("subjects")
plt.ylabel("marks")
plt.title("distribution of marks")
```
